# react-forecast

High temperature display app to demo React/Redux/Redux-Saga to my team.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `npm install`.

This app will not work without the addition of a JSON file in `src/api.json`. This file should contain your Dark Sky API key as well as your latitude and longitude.

```
{
  apiKey : String (Dark Sky API Key)
  latitude: Number (Latitude of Location)
  longitude : Number (Longitude of Location)
}
```

Once you’ve created your config JSON file, you’re ready to run `npm start`. The page should load in your browser automatically.
